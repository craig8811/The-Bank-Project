# The-Bank-Project
This project uses a banking dataset of 10,000 unique records to explore the relationship between customer demographics, spending habits, risk, and churn rates. The project then develops a customer segmentation model that can be used to predict future churn rates and develop strategies to retain customers. The following steps were taken:

* The data was cleaned and explored using SQL and Tableau.

* Trends in customers who are at risk of leaving the bank were discovered.

* A dashboard was produced that visualizes the key customer metrics, the prominent customer segments, their average RFM values by month, a   matrix of RFM values(1-5) with the corresponding churn rate, and customer segments most likely to churn complete with their demographic and spending habits.

We give our thanks to SAKSHI GOYAL of Kaggle for openly sharing this data collected from leaps analyttica so we could use it in this analysis.
